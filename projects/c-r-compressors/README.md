# R-C-compressors
R&amp;C website

Create a new branch for every update of code.

BRANCH NAMEING PROTOCOL 

    *short descriptive word or words that describe what the update is. such as "nav_animate"
    
    *seperate words with underscore(_)
    
    *include date + time in the format m/dd 00:00; example "6/29_09:11" (use military time so am and pm r not needed
    
    *full example "nav_animate_6/26_09:16
   
 CODE NAMEING PROTOCOL
 
    *descriptive and referable short names. The names should be dynamic and thoughtful. for instance nameing a css varible
        :root{                                      :root{
           --red_background: red;                      main_bg_color: red;
        }                                            }
        naming it red background is bad because if we change the color of the website theme it no longer makes since. requireing more work
        to maintain code. nameing it main_bg_color is short simple and if we change the color it still makes since.
        
    *use all lowercase letters to prevent problems when loading onto web server. this includes images and file names.
    
    *seperate words with underscores(_). example nav_anmiation
 
 CODE INDENTION
 
   *Two spaces. You can set you code editer tab to two spaces
